You are a beautiful person, inside, and out.
You are doing great.  Don't give up.  Life is hard at times, but you're an incredible person, and you are loved.
You are a strong person, and you are appreciated.  There's over 7 billion people on this planet, but your friends chose you :)
Anyone who meets you would understand it's a privilege to do so, you are a beautiful person.
I heard you're great at pwning noobs, and I appreciate that.  Badass zombie slayers are hard to come by.  Keep it up boo.
You make people happy, and we appreciate you.  You're capable, and a badass human being.
We're all made of stardust.  Every living thing.  What a treat it is, to consider, that we are the universe experiencing itself for a short time.  You are appreciated, and your friends love you.
Thank you for being an awesome friend.  You're appreciated and your friends think you're incredible.
